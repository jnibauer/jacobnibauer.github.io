I am a third year graduate student at Princeton University in the department of astrophysical sciences. Lately, my research has focused on leveraging stellar streams in the Milky Way and external galaxies to constrain dark matter from the scale of the stellar halo down to subhalos. This site is meant to serve as a repository of my past research projects and some ongoing work. It also contains materials I have used for teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was a multivariable calculus teaching assistant for several semesters.
