I am a first year graduate student at Princeton University in the department of astrophysical sciences. Lately, my research has focused on Galactic Dynamics, Galactic Archeology, and various topics in astrostatistics and machine learning. This site is meant to serve as a repository of my past research projects and some ongoing work. It also contains materials I have used for teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was a multivariable calculus teaching assistant for several semesters. 

You can usually find me in Peyton hall (Princeton, NJ) or at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (New York, NY). This Summer, I will be at Carnegie Observatories (Pasadena, CA).
